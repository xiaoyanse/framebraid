# FrameBraid Windows candidate / Windows 候选说明

## v0.3.1 (2026-11-02)

Audit-fix release, no ABI break (prefix compatibility strengthened). Fixes review issues #2-#8:
encode/archive/stream dimension validation (no OOB reads on mismatched views), CUDA buffer RAII
(no leak on second-allocation failure), MP4 finish-error propagation (no false save-success),
RTMP connect budget with interruptible backoff (15s total, stop-wake, camera.timeout), encoded
PTS/DTS/time_base pass-through, legacy 48/40-byte struct prefix negotiation (am_image_input_t /
am_frame_sub_desc_t), C# binding regains the gpu field. Also fixes 10 same-pattern findings from
a whole-repo audit and 2 high-severity extended-audit findings (batching three-lock deadlock,
DETACH drain false-success). GPU frame handle exports return notSupported until the closed loop
lands. 402 unit tests + real-FFmpeg suite green, failure list identical to pre-change baseline.
/ 审查修复版，无 ABI 破坏（前缀兼容增强）：编码尺寸校验、CUDA 缓冲 RAII、MP4 结束错误
上抛、RTMP 连接预算与可唤醒退避、编码时间线贯通、旧版结构前缀协商、C# 绑定补齐；含全仓
模式审计同修 10 项与扩展审计高危 2 项（攒批三锁环、DETACH 假成功）。GPU 帧句柄族在闭环
落地前统一 notSupported。402 单测+真机套件全绿，失败清单与基线一致。

## v0.2.0 (2026-10-28)

Compatible-addition release. Media/Vision SDK move to C ABI 1.1 (r9 frozen artifacts): explicit
hardware decode/inference probes with bounded cached reports, RTSP decode-policy entry and
source snapshots; everything from 1.0 keeps layout and semantics. New adaptive batching extension
(`amv_model_configure_batching`/`amv_model_get_batching`, AUTO semantics, dynamic-batch-axis models
only, off by default). Hot-path improvements with bit-exact outputs (NV12 table conversion -23%,
tensor direct write, sampling cadence). Four-language examples revalidated from a clean package;
R1–R5 OpenSpec workstreams closed with verification records in docs/verification.

Known-unverified (registered, not blocking): four of five real model classes lack local weights;
CUDA/OpenVINO execution providers absent on the validation machine; field streams and fixed
long-duration runs remain out of per user decision; GPU decode under the CPU-RGBA readback
contract measured not to save CPU on the test GPUs across 1/2/4 lanes.

## v0.1.0 (2026-10-25)

Version 0.1.0 developer preview, authorized for public distribution. Media SDK and Vision SDK use
C ABI 1.0 r5; legacy DLL and symbol names remain for compatibility.

Windows x64 CPU candidate: Release build, both shared-frame features enabled.
The recorded pass covers 177 Rust tests and 11 packaged-DLL groups with
C/C++17/C#/Python calls, synthetic media fixtures and generated CPU test graphs.
All five real-weight model profiles were not rerun end-to-end in this pass.
GPU, hardware decoding, other platforms and field/long-duration acceptance are separate.

Use the package build record and artifact/runtime manifest for exact identity.
Model weights, environment files, customer data and internal logs are excluded.
Matching runtime licensing/source materials accompany the Windows candidate;
finite validation does not establish field or long-duration guarantees.

0.1.0 开发者预览版，首发面向 Windows x64 CPU。限定结果为 177 项 Rust 单测及 11 组 DLL
验证；不将其视为五类真实权重、GPU、硬解、其他平台、长期或现场验收。
